# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning 🚗

## Internship
Data Science Internship – CodeAlpha

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars using machine
learning techniques. The prediction is based on various car features such
as year of purchase, fuel type, transmission type, and kilometers driven.

## Dataset
- File name: `car data.csv`
- The dataset contains information about used cars and their selling prices.

### Features Used
- Year
- Present Price
- Kms Driven
- Fuel Type
- Selling Type
- Transmission
- Owner

### Target Variable
- Selling Price

## Machine Learning Algorithm
- **Linear Regression**

Linear Regression is used to understand the relationship between car
features and the selling price.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Encoded categorical variables
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
4. Trained a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated the model using regression metrics

## Model Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## Conclusion
The model predicts car selling prices with good accuracy and demonstrates
the application of regression techniques in real-world scenarios.
